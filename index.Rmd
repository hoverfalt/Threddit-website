### Showing the real cost of clothes
This is my personal project attempting to build a proper understanding of the real cost and eventually environmental impact of my use of clothes. The data set is a continuous daily log of my use of each piece of garnment since 1 January 2018. In addition to showing the real cost per wear and frequency of use for each garnment, this enables studying the correlation between price and quality (as measured by durability), as well as actual vs imagined use.

### Making data-supported consumption choices
Visibility into item-level cost efficiency has been eye-opening in many ways. My main goal is not to drive down cost though, but to make better consumption choices especially from a sustainability perspective. This means only buying what I need, actually using what I have, and taking good care of each item to maximise its lifetime. Visibility helps in uncovering and quantifying opportunities for improvement, but also provides settlement and peace of mind in choices that would otherwise keep being questioned.

### Broadening consumption comparability
Since the use data is exhaustive both in terms of assets and time, the portfolio level shows the complete use by category (kind of clothing). This enables studying the cost of the "utility of clothing" per category and as a whole. This in turn makes the use of clothes comparable to not only other types of physical assets that deteriorate with use (e.g. a coffee machine), but to service models providing any utility, be it physical (e.g. public transport) or intangible (e.g. Spotify).
