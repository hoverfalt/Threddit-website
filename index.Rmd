"Threddit" is my project attempting to build a proper understanding of the real cost of the use of clothes.

### Real cost per wear
As opposed to the traditional accounting approach of depreciating an asset over its expected lifetime, I track the actual use of each asset (piece of clothing) to determine its real cost per wear and frequency of use. This enables studying the correlation between price and quality, as well as actual vs imagined use.

### Clothes as utility
Since the use data is exhaustive both in terms of assets and time, the portfolio level shows the complete use by category (kind of clothing). This enables studying the cost of the "utility of clothing" per category and as a whole. This in turn makes the use of clothes comparable to not only other types of physical assets that deteriorate with use, but to service models (XaaS) providing any utility, be it physical or intangible.

### Data
The data comprises all pieces of garnment and wear data for each day since 1 January 2018.
